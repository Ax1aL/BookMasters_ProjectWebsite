Here is the main site.
It has an array of names for books.Then from a hash table it get the value of each book which is a description of it and we have another set for the images.
Then for each book it creates a "block" which has the image,name and description.
You can click on it to reveal the comments and reviews on it.
After that you can click on history tab to see the most recent books you clicked on.
The main point was to create a basic site and to test some capabilities of php and sql.
